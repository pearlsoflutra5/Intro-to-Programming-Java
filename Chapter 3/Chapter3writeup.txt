  Chapter 3 is about Conditions. Boolean data is using conditions to write statements that have true or false anwers. If statements allow a a condition to have multiple path answers. An if else statement, allows multiple conditions to take play. Any of the if and else statements can be nested inside of each other to make it possible for many different statements to be run. This allows for generating random numbers or generating a tx with multiple age options and incomes. Braces and semicolons are commonly used throughout all of java and are needed to be placed exactly right. Throughout all of Java it is imperitive that the order and puctuation is learned quickly, otherwise several errors will occur.  Logical operators allow a statement to have multiples rules where two or more have to apply for it to be true or false. Switch statements allow a value of a variable to determine what statement is run. Conditional statements are similar to if statements without a declared if. The statement is written on a single line and it is based on the conditions that are written. Operators are like PEMDAS, or order of operations, there is a heiarchy that determines what is run first and some are on the same line so they are run left to right like it is read. The last thing to remember is debuggigng. In many of these statements ther are logical errors that the computerdoesn't catch because it will run it may not put the correct number if figured out by hand.
