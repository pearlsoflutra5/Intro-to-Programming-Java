# Intro-to-Programming-Java

All files from examples and exercises from my Intro to Programming Class. 

These were guided exercises to make sure I got the logic and programming right, but all basic skills of java were learned from the beginning. I was also instructed in the basics of Github and command line which are valuable skills for future careers.
